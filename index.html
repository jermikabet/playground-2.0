  <h1> About </h1>  

 <p> I decided to do an articles about axolotls and the basic necessitate they need to be happy  as well as healthy. </p>

<p>No human being, however great, or powerful, was ever so free as a fish.

<h2> what is an axolotl ? </h2>

<ul>

<li> <strong> COMMON NAME </strong> : Axolotl </li>

<li> <strong> CIENTIFIC NAME </strong> : Ambystoma mexicanum </li>

<li> <strong> TYPE </strong> : Amphibians </li>

<li> <strong> DIET </strong> : Carnivore </li>

<li> <strong> AVERAGE LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD </strong> : 10 to 15 years </li>

<li> <strong> SIZE </strong> : Up to 12 inches </li>

<li> <strong> WEIGHT </strong> : 2.11 to 8 ounces </li>

</ul>

<p> The axolotl, Ambystoma mexicanum, also known as the Mexican walking fish, is a neotenic salamander related to the tiger salamander. Although the axolotl is colloquially known as a "walking fish", it is not a fish, but an amphibian. </p>

  

<h2> Types of axolotls</h2>

  

 <h3> Axolotls come in many different colors </h3>

 <p> <strong>Wild-Type</strong>: Mottled green with bright eyes purple gills. </p>

<p> <strong>variations</strong> : Other, less common morphs may include Piebald, Golden Non Albino, and Chimaerism.</p>

<h2> Habitat </h2>
<p>The setup of an aquarium is largely a matter of preference. There are different sizes of tanks where axolotls are kept. Axolotls range in sizes from the very young to adults with a varying length of 12 inches or even more. The very young are often kept in a standard 10-gallon tank while the very large once require a 20-gallon tank. </p>

<p> A fish tank is just interactive television for cats.

PROS :heavy_check_mark: | CONS :x:
------------ | -------------
It can be used for a wide range of purposes.| It’s quite expensive.
Quality construction and well made. | If you are a beginner you might find it hard to choose equipment.
Tank only package so you can choose your preferred equipment you. | The sealant is a little messy.
Gives you slightly more space length ways than an regular 20 gallon tank | the bigger the tank the bigger the filter

<p>Before you introduce axolotl make sure that you have filters in the new aquarium. This aids in allowing the water to settle as well as the filtration of the bacteria. You should keep an eye on the parameters of the water while using the test kits sold at the aquarium stores. Make sure that the water is cycled weakly or bi-weekly and at least 40-50% of the water is removed and replaced with conditioned tap water.

 It should not be hot or cold. You should also ensure that you remove anything that is at the bottom of the tank. Objects such as uneaten food, poop may create ammonia if not removed which is toxic for the axolotl. Ammonia is very harmful as it can kill the axolotl. You should never accidentally hit your axolotl with your siphon and it can cause serious bodily harm. In case you find trouble working with a siphon while the Axolotl is in the tank then make an effort to remove it. </p>



<h2> Axolotl Diet </h2>
<p>In captivity, axolotls eat a variety of readily available foods, including trout and salmon pellets, frozen or live blood worms, earthworms, and wax worms. Axolotls can also eat  feeder fish, but care should be taken as fish may contain <em> parasites </em>. </p>

<h2> were you can buy your own axolotl ? </h2>
<p> Where to buy Axolotl? As a first-time buyer, I would always suggest going in store to buy an Axolotl, ideally to from a reputable breeder and not from a generic big brand pet store. If that isn’t an option for you, then you can buy online from several online sellers with good reputations below. </p>

- [buy-axolotls.com](https://www.buy-axolotls.com/)
- [joshsfrogs.com](https://www.joshsfrogs.com/)
- [backwaterreptiles.com](https://www.backwaterreptiles.com/)
-  [undergroundreptiles.com](https://undergroundreptiles.com/)

<p> You should look for a supplier who provides delivery services. The supplier should be able to guarantee delivery of axolotl that is live 100%. To ensure their survival the temperatures should be at the recommended level during packaging and transportation. In case the supplier arrives with a dead axolotl then they should consider replacement or refund. </p>

<h1> Plans For Future Development </h1>

<p> For the more advanced care takers i would like to talk more bout what you can put in the tank with you pet such as substate, plants, and what other paets can live with you axolotl as well as health consenrs that may pop up. </p>
